# K_Means_Clustering_From_Scratch
 
## Description

In this notebook, I created a K-Means Clustering model from scratch using Python. Then I used scikit-learn's make_blobs function to generate a sample of 3000 5-centroids Gaussian blobs to evaluate the performance of my model. In the end, the model correctly classify all the blobs into the 5 clusters.  

## Data

The clustering data is generated usign scikit-learn's make_blobs function. Specifically, the blobs generated for this notebook is as follows:

</p>

## Evaluation

The final clustering done by my model is as follows:

</p>

This shows that my implementation successfully done the clustering task.
